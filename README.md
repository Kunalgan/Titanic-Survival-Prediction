# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
The Titanic survival prediction problem is a classic machine learning project. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on various features such as age, gender, passenger class, etc. In this project, we will use Python and its libraries to train a machine learning model for this prediction.
